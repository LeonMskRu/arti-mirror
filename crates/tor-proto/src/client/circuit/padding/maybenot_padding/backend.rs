//! Padding backend based on [`maybenot`].
//!
//! # Operation
//!
//! For each each circuit hop, we have an optional [`maybenot::Framework`].
//! This framework wraps multiple "padding machines",
//! each of which is a randomized state machine.
//! (Arti is built with a list of pre-configured of padding machines.
//! The set of padding machines to use with any given circuit hop
//! are negotiated via `PADDING_NEGOTIATE` messages.)
//! We interact with the framework via
//! [`Framework::trigger_events`](maybenot::Framework::trigger_events),
//! which consumes [`TriggerEvent`]s and gives us [`TriggerAction`]s.
//! Those `TriggerAction`s tell us to schedule or reschedule different timers,
//! to block traffic, or to send padding.
//!
//! We wrap the `Framework` in [`MaybenotPadder`],
//! which keeps track of the expiration time for each timer.
//! From `MaybenotPadder`, we expose a single timer
//! describing when the next action from the padding machine may be necessary.
//! This timer is likely to update frequently.
